0. 0-rectangle.js
>Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
>You must use the class notation for defining your class

1. 1-rectangle.js
>Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
>You must use the class notation for defining your class
>The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
>Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
>Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h

2. 2-rectangle.js
>Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
>You must use the class notation for defining your class
>The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
>Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
>Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
>If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object

3. 3-rectangle.js
>Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
>You must use the class notation for defining your class

5. 5-square.js
>Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js:
>You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends
>The constructor must take 1 argument: size
